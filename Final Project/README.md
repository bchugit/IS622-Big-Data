## IS622 Final Project - What's So Funny?

In this project, I look at sense of humor from the perspective of written jokes and try to see if commonalities can be discerned using collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation system techniques. A secondary objective is determining whether sense of humor can be better predicted by similarity with other persons or by specific joke features. Finally, I aim to improve on common recommendation system models by investigating a multi-stage approach using clustering.
